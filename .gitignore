# Files that should be generated on the fly
# We want to commit the pubspec.yaml, but not the lock file if working in a team on a library.
# For an application, it's often better to commit the lock file to ensure consistent builds.
# We will commit it for now, but if you were building a reusable package, you'd uncomment this.
